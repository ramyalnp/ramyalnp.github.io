I’ve always loved making sense of things — whether that’s parsing noisy RNA-seq data, figuring out why a metabolic readout doesn’t match a mouse’s behavior, or simply trying to understand what makes people tick.

This space is where I unpack thoughts, questions, and discoveries — from research quirks to scientific rabbit holes I’ve wandered down. Some posts are reflective, some technical, and some just curious detours triggered by a dataset, a conversation, or a really weird paper.

**A few things about me that don’t show up in a CV:**

- Even after four full rewatches of Attack on Titan, I still haven’t made peace with the ending.
- I love badminton, playing chess, and the emotional chaos of combat sports.
- And yes — I’m absolutely going to make it to an Ariana Grande concert one day. Manifesting...!

**A quote that taught me to love science — in all its good and bad:**

> *“…If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all.”*  
> <small>— *Erwin Schrödinger*</small>

Thanks for reading — and for caring about ideas, science, and stories!
