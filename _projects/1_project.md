At Stanford University, I work in the [Svensson Lab](https://www.svenssonlabstanford.org), where I study how peptides regulate energy metabolism and appetite, particularly in disease models like obesity, GI cancers, and gut-brain axis dysfunction. With over 500 candidate peptides in play, I’ve combined molecular assays with computational strategies to identify the most promising therapeutic targets.

- Designed and conducted in vitro screens using western blotting, qPCR, and metabolic assays across various mammalian cell lines
- Performed in vivo peptide dosing (IP, IV, SC) in lean and knockout mouse models, measuring food/water intake, VO₂, VCO₂,and RER in metabolic cages
- Performed cAMP assay (similar to ELISA) to look for energy expenditure through ATP detection
- Developed machine learning–driven RNA-seq pipelines (Nextflow + Groovy) to prioritize peptide hits based on transcriptional signatures linked to metabolic regulation.
