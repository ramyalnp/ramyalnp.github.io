      <h2 class="mb-3">Ever wonder if the rent <em>really</em> is too damn high?</h2>
      <p>Me too.</p>
      <p>In this project, I dive into the <strong>California housing dataset</strong> to explore what drives the cost of a roof over your head. Using <strong>simple linear regression</strong> for a baseline and a <strong>random forest model</strong> for that predictive edge, I train and test models to see if we can outsmart the rental market—or at least understand it a little better.</p>
      <p>Whether it's <em>proximity to the bay</em> or <em>median income per household</em>, I'm letting the data do the talking. Pretty sure the models won't have anything nice to say about the current market...<em>sigh</em>. 🏡📈🌴</p>
