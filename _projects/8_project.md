        I worked at the <a href="https://www.neurobiology.ca/people" target="_blank">Ryan Lab</a> to explore how the extracellular matrix contributes to amyloid transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Using molecular assays, I studied how iPSCs differentiate into cardiomyocytes and tested how TTR aggregates affect their health and function.

      <li>Designed and optimized a robust differentiation protocol to derive cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).</li>
      <li>Performed immunocytochemistry using cardiac-specific biomarkers to assess cell phenotype and maturation.</li>
      <li>Utilized confocal microscopy to visualize and validate cardiomyocyte differentiation via expression of structural and functional markers.</li>
      <li>Applied Volocity image analysis software to quantify marker expression and identify molecular cues that enhanced cardiomyocyte yield.</li>
      <li>Established a transthyretin toxicity assay to evaluate cell viability and phenotypic changes in response to TTR exposure.</li>
