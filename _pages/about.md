Hi! I’m Ramya—a biomedical researcher who loves asking bold questions about how our bodies work, and what happens when they don’t. My work blends hands-on molecular biology with computational analysis to make sense of complex disease models, especially in the realms of metabolism and neuroscience.

Right now, I’m working full-time at [Stanford University](https://www.svenssonlabstanford.org), where I dive into data and experiments to understand disease state fundamentals that influence appetite regulation or energy metabolism (eg:- obesity). I’ve previously worked with CRISPR-edited stem cells, built pipelines to analyze large single-cell datasets, and draw out results that could be directly applicable to the molecular assay results. 

I’m also passionate about bridging science with real-world impact. Whether it’s exploring the regulation of medical devices, co-hosting a podcast that unpacks biotech ethics, or thinking through how data science can serve public health, I’m always up for a conversation that connects disciplines.

You might’ve come across my [GitHub](https://github.com/ramyalnp) where I share code for data-driven biology, or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramya0001/). If not—feel free to check them out!

I’m always open to teaming up on new ideas, writing, or research. Reach me at [your email] if you're curious to collaborate.

Things I’m currently into:

- Making sense of complex diseases through experiments + code
- Building reproducible pipelines for single-cell and spatial data
- Exploring social behavior through the lens of health data
- Translating research into tools people can actually use
