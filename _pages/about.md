Hi, I’m Ramya—a biomedical engineer and biotech graduate from *Cornell University*, now working full-time at [Stanford University](https://www.svenssonlabstanford.org), where I study how the brain regulates whole-body physiology, especially metabolism and appetite. I work at the interface of stem cell biology, neurobiology, and metabolic disease, using both experimental and computational approaches to understand how disrupted molecular signaling can lead to conditions like fatty liver disease, obesity, or neurodevelopmental disorders.

My research blends CRISPR-based gene editing, iPSC-derived organoid models, transcriptomics, and machine learning. I’ve built analysis pipelines for large-scale single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, and I use these tools to dissect cellular heterogeneity, model disease progression, and identify new therapeutic targets.

You might’ve come across my [GitHub](https://github.com/ramyalnp) where I share code for data-driven biology, or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramya0001/). If not—feel free to check them out!

Beyond the lab, I’m passionate about science that translates—whether that’s exploring regulatory frameworks for emerging biotechnologies, drug discovery,surgical robots, etc. I’m always open to teaming up on new ideas, writing, or research. Reach me at [rl001@stanford.edu](mailto:rl001@stanford.edu) if you're curious to collaborate. 

Right now, I’m especially excited by:

- Generative models to simulate cell state transitions and perturbations
- Building reproducible pipelines for single-cell and spatial -omics data
- Using stem cell and in-vivo models to study disease mechanisms
- Modeling protein structure and dynamics to understand cellular signaling
